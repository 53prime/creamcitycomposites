                    <h3>Why Carbon Fiber?</h3>
                    <p>Carbon fiber has become a staple of many industries in the past 20 years, and with good reason. Whether you’re building a race/show car, in the medical industry, or even military-related, it has a very useful and important role.</p>
                    <p>Carbon Fiber has several traits that can make it crucial to any industry. For one, carbon fiber is extremely strong. It is <strong>10x stronger than steel</strong>, and <strong>8x stronger than aluminum</strong>. Any application imaginable where strength is needed, and is currently being remedied by the use of steel or aluminum, can easily be replaced by carbon fiber, with all of its advantages.</p>
                    <p>The second important use of carbon fiber is its <strong>weight saving quality</strong>. As a matter of fact, carbon weighs 5x less than steel and 1.5 times lighter than aluminum. To be able to provide that kind of saving lends itself to many different markets. Aeronautics is just one field that it has completely revolutionized. It has become an absolute staple for anything that takes flight. Being as strong as we know it is and being able to provide those weight savings, the possibilities are endless.</p>
                    <p>The last but certainly not the least major attribute is the <strong>absolute beauty of carbon fiber</strong>. From a standard 1×1 or 2×2 crosshatch weave, all the way to multi-color hounds tooth, your imagination is the only limitation you have when it comes to whatever pattern or color you want to use. Besides the versatility of the patterns, nothing surpasses the clean carbon look contrasting with the other colors of a show car built just the way someone intended.</p>
                    <p>Add the practically <strong>zero thermal expansion</strong> of carbon, and its exceptionally attractive appearance, you can easily understand why it is so popular with applications in many industries</p>
