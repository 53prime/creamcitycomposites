                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Like they say, necessity is the mother of invention. Sometimes, when you have a big idea, the only space you have available for expansion is in your garage. This wasn’t a deterrent for the our founder, who in ’98 hunkered down and started making replacement carbon fiber parts for his friends in his modest Milwaukee garage. He didn’t have much in the way of office space, but he did have a great deal of determination and raw talent, all of which helped draw the attention of numerous friends, who suddenly all needed his services.</p>
                    <p>A few years later, his talents became even more popular than he expected, giving him the idea to engage in a full-fledged business—and in doing so, Prototype Composites was formed. The parts he created early helped to form a solid foundation for his new business. What originally started as a side business had now flourished and grown into an established company, recognized for producing top-quality components for Audi, Camaro, Corvette, BMW, EVO, Lotus, GTR, and others.</p>
                    <p>The leadership of the business changed hands a few times during the years with each new owner adding new capabilities. Most recently Kilby Williamson acquired the business and along with the key employees created a roadmap to take the company to the next level.</p>
                    <p>It didn’t take long for Prototype Composites to expand into new markets and product lines. The company officially branched off the motorsports business as Cream City Composites in 2018, and has since then solidified its name as a top-quality manufacturer of carbon fiber composites for the motorsports industry.</p>
